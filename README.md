# Stock-and-Emotion-colleration
This is a system I built for my experiment to find colleration between Investment decision making and investorâ€™s emotion and information.

Participants observe the changing stock charts and information about the stock and submit their observations to our database. 

I chose to use Django as my framework because I plan to publish it online for participants to use. To use this file, you will need to install Django and Yfinance.

To start the server, run "python manage.py runserver" in your terminal.
